# /possiblaw-guardrails:guardrails

View the active safety guardrails protecting your workspace.

## Overview

The PossibLaw guardrails plugin operates globally by installing safety hooks in your environment. These hooks intercept dangerous actions before they execute.

## Active Protections

By default, the guardrails plugin monitors for:
1. **Destructive Commands:** Blocks dangerous commands like `rm -rf`.
2. **Stop Prompts Validation:** Safely manages state when waiting for user input.
3. **Sensitive File Edits:** Warns when credentials or critical files are modified.

To see the exact rules and prompt changes applied, review your local `.claude/settings.json` or the plugin `hooks/` config files.
