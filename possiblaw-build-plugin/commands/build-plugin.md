# /possiblaw-build-plugin:build-plugin

Questionnaire-driven plugin builder.

## Workflow

1. Check whether `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` exists; recommend adding one first if missing.
2. Classify what the user wants to build: command, skill, hook, agent, or full plugin.
3. Ask only the targeted questions needed for that artifact.
4. Propose a file plan and get explicit approval before writing anything.
5. Generate minimal, correct scaffolding consistent with the Claude Code plugin structure.
