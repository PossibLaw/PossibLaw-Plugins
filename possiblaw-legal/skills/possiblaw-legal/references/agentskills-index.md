- Detail endpoint: `https://api.case.dev/skills/{slug}`
- Markdown fallback: `https://agentskills.legal/skills/{slug}.md`

## Parsing Notes

- Search responses include a `results` list with candidate skills and slugs for retrieval.
- Detail responses for `/{slug}` include full skill content plus metadata such as legal context.
- `/possiblaw-legal` should normalize API output into the plugin candidate model and degrade gracefully to markdown fallback.
