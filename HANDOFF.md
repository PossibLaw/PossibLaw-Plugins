# HANDOFF

Date: 2026-02-23
Repo: `/Users/salvadorcarranza/Plugins`
Branch: `main`
Remote: `origin` (`https://github.com/PossibLaw/PossibLaw-Plugins.git`)
Status: Ready to push to `origin/main`.

## What Was Updated (2026-02-23)

### 1) Canonical plugin slugs and paths
- Renamed plugin package folders to match marketplace/plugin IDs:
  - `possiblaw-build-plugin/`
  - `possiblaw-guardrails/`
  - `possiblaw-legal/`
  - `possiblaw-vibe/`
- Updated marketplace sources accordingly:
  - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

### 2) Slash command surfaces added
- Added explicit `commands/` files so Claude Code has canonical `/possiblaw-*` command entries:
  - `possiblaw-build-plugin/commands/possiblaw-build-plugin.md`
  - `possiblaw-guardrails/commands/possiblaw-guardrails.md`
  - `possiblaw-legal/commands/possiblaw-legal.md`
  - `possiblaw-vibe/commands/possiblaw-vibe.md`

### 3) Skills canonicalization (prevents wrong labels like legal-assistant/build-plugin)
- Renamed packaged skill directories to match plugin IDs:
  - `possiblaw-build-plugin/skills/possiblaw-build-plugin/`
  - `possiblaw-legal/skills/possiblaw-legal/`
- Updated skill `name:` values in SKILL.md frontmatter to match the canonical IDs:
  - `possiblaw-build-plugin`
  - `possiblaw-legal`
- Removed the project-local `.claude/skills/*` copies so everything is marketplace-driven.

### 4) Docs and runtime path fixes
- Updated README/docs to reference new plugin paths and `retrieval/` runtime invocation.
- Updated possiblaw-legal retrieval adapters to use plugin-root-relative fallback catalogs:
  - `skills/possiblaw-legal/references/*`

### 5) Marketplace-only usage
- Removed local `.claude/skills` to ensure the UI doesn’t show duplicate/non-canonical options when plugins are installed via marketplace.

## Versions at Handoff
- `possiblaw-build-plugin`: `1.2.0`
- `possiblaw-guardrails`: `1.1.0`
- `possiblaw-legal`: `1.4.0`
- `possiblaw-vibe`: `1.3.0`

## Commits Pushed (latest first)
- `5bc4e0d` fix(legal-skills): ask source first and refine stop-hook waiting behavior
- `8fc795a` feat(commands): namespace plugin commands under possiblaw
- `579b3d9` chore(legal-skills): bump to 1.2.1 to force clean plugin cache
- `9a6de5e` docs: update root README for legal-skills unified retrieval
- `1ab7002` feat(legal-skills): add unified context retrieval runtime and source adapters

All above were pushed to `origin/main`.

## Validation Performed
- Retrieval test suite:
  - `node --test possiblaw-legal/retrieval/tests/*.test.mjs`
  - Result: all tests passed.
- Guardrails tests:
  - `python3 -m pytest -q possiblaw-guardrails/tests`
  - Result: all tests passed.
- JSON validation (plugin/hook manifests) performed with `jq`.
- Local command file checks confirm `commands/possiblaw-*.md` exists for each plugin.

## Local Environment Actions (non-repo)
These were done on the operator machine to resolve stale command listings in Claude UI:
- Marketplace refreshed: `claude plugin marketplace update PossibLaw`
- Plugin updates executed:
  - `claude plugin update possiblaw-build-plugin@PossibLaw`
  - `claude plugin update possiblaw-vibe@PossibLaw`
  - `claude plugin update possiblaw-legal@PossibLaw`
  - `claude plugin update possiblaw-guardrails@PossibLaw`
- Old cached plugin version folders containing legacy commands were removed from `~/.claude/plugins/cache/PossibLaw/...`.

## Known Notes
- Some user-facing changes require Claude Code restart after plugin update to fully refresh command picker.
- `possiblaw-legal` still uses `api.case.dev` for structured skills lookup and `agentskills.legal` as site/fallback content source (intentional).
- Unrelated local plugin note observed: `superpowers@claude-plugins-official` had a local permission/cache error in this environment.

## Recommended Next-Agent Checks
1. Verify marketplace command picker shows only:
   - `/possiblaw-build-plugin`
   - `/possiblaw-vibe`
   - `/possiblaw-legal`
2. Run `/possiblaw-legal` with no arguments and confirm:
   - source picker is asked first
   - source-specific query prompt appears second
3. Smoke test retrieval runtime:
   - `node possiblaw-legal/retrieval/run-search.mjs --query "indemnification" --source all --json --pretty`
4. If stale commands reappear in user UI, re-run marketplace update and plugin updates, then restart Claude Code.
