## Available Plugins

### build-plugin

Interactive plugin builder for Claude Code. Asks targeted questions to determine the right extensibility mechanism — CLAUDE.md files, skills, commands, hooks, or agents — then generates properly structured files following documented patterns. Whether you're creating your first plugin or your tenth, it walks you through the full process from intent to working code.

```bash
claude plugin install build-plugin --marketplace PossibLaw
```

### project-vibe

Discovery-first project planning for non-coders. Guides you through defining your project goals, budget constraints, and tech stack selection — then generates a complete dev environment with docs, helper scripts, a debugging agent, and slash commands. Starts with your goals and works backward to technical decisions, so you don't need to know what a database is to get started.

```bash
claude plugin install project-vibe --marketplace PossibLaw
```
