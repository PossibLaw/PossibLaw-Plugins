# PossibLaw Plugins

Claude Code plugins built by the PossibLaw team.

## Runtime Support

- **Claude Code:** Full plugin install support via marketplace (`claude plugin install ...`).
- **Codex:** Not installable as Claude plugins. Use the plugin docs/workflows directly in Codex, and configure required MCP servers with `codex mcp ...`.

## Available Plugins

### build-plugin

Interactive plugin builder for Claude Code. Asks targeted questions to determine the right extensibility mechanism — CLAUDE.md files, skills, commands, hooks, or agents — then generates properly structured files following documented patterns. Whether you're creating your first plugin or your tenth, it walks you through the full process from intent to working code.

```bash
claude plugin install build-plugin --marketplace PossibLaw
```

### guardrails

General-purpose safety hooks for Claude Code. Blocks destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `sudo rm`, `curl | bash`, force-push to main), protects sensitive files (`.env`, SSH keys, credentials), auto-formats code after writes, and validates task completion before sessions end. Ships with a curated blacklist and escalation prompts for risky-but-not-fatal commands.

```bash
claude plugin install guardrails --marketplace PossibLaw
```

### legal-skills

Single-command legal workflow plugin for novice builders. `/legal` searches Lawvable and Case.dev Agent Skills, returns the top matches, and guides the user through selection, skill ingestion, and confirmation-driven application in-session.

```bash
claude plugin install legal-skills --marketplace PossibLaw
```

### project-vibe

Discovery-first project planning for non-coders. Guides you through defining your project goals, budget constraints, and tech stack selection — then generates a complete dev environment with docs, helper scripts, a debugging agent, and slash commands. Starts with your goals and works backward to technical decisions, so you don't need to know what a database is to get started.

```bash
claude plugin install project-vibe --marketplace PossibLaw
```

## Getting Started

### Option A: Using the interactive UI

1. Open Claude Code and type `/plugin`
2. Press the **right arrow key** to navigate to the **Discover** tab
3. Select **Add Marketplace**
4. Enter the GitHub repo: `PossibLaw/PossibLaw-Plugins`
5. Once added, browse the marketplace and install any plugin from the list

### Option B: Using the command line

First, add the PossibLaw marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add --source github --repo PossibLaw/PossibLaw-Plugins
```

Then install any plugin:

```bash
claude plugin install build-plugin --marketplace PossibLaw
claude plugin install guardrails --marketplace PossibLaw
claude plugin install legal-skills --marketplace PossibLaw
claude plugin install project-vibe --marketplace PossibLaw
```

## What's Next

More plugins are on the way to help legal professionals architect what's next in legal. Stay tuned.

## Using These in Codex

These packages are authored in Claude plugin format, so Codex does not install them with `claude plugin install`.

Use this pattern instead:

1. Open the plugin's workflow docs and run the same process in Codex.
2. Configure any external MCP dependency in Codex (example for legal skills):
   `codex mcp add agentskills --url https://skills.case.dev/api/mcp`
3. In Codex prompts, explicitly request that workflow (example: "Use the legal workflow from this repo and show top 5 skills for contract review").

For legal-skills specifically, see:
- `legal-skills/docs/codex-usage.md`
- `legal-skills/docs/agent-contract.md`
