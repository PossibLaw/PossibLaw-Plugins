## Available Plugins

### build-plugin

Interactive plugin builder for Claude Code. Asks targeted questions to determine the right extensibility mechanism — CLAUDE.md files, skills, commands, hooks, or agents — then generates properly structured files following documented patterns. Whether you're creating your first plugin or your tenth, it walks you through the full process from intent to working code.

```bash
claude plugin install build-plugin --marketplace PossibLaw
```

### guardrails

General-purpose safety hooks for Claude Code. Blocks destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `sudo rm`, `curl | bash`, force-push to main), protects sensitive files (`.env`, SSH keys, credentials), auto-formats code after writes, and validates task completion before sessions end. Ships with a curated blacklist and escalation prompts for risky-but-not-fatal commands.

```bash
claude plugin install guardrails --marketplace PossibLaw
```

### legal-skills

Single-command legal workflow plugin for novice builders. `/legal` searches Lawvable and Case.dev Agent Skills, returns the top matches, and guides the user through selection, skill ingestion, and confirmation-driven application in-session.

```bash
claude plugin install legal-skills --marketplace PossibLaw
```

### project-vibe

Discovery-first project planning for non-coders. Guides you through defining your project goals, budget constraints, and tech stack selection — then generates a complete dev environment with docs, helper scripts, a debugging agent, and slash commands. Starts with your goals and works backward to technical decisions, so you don't need to know what a database is to get started.

```bash
claude plugin install project-vibe --marketplace PossibLaw
```
