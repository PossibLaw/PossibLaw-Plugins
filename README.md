# PossibLaw Plugins

Claude Code plugins built by the PossibLaw team.

## Runtime Support

- **Claude Code:** Full plugin install support via marketplace (`claude plugin install ...`).
- **Codex:** Not installable as Claude plugins. Use the plugin docs/workflows directly in Codex, and configure required MCP servers with `codex mcp ...`.

## Available Plugins

### possiblaw-build-plugin

Interactive plugin builder for Claude Code. Use `/possiblaw-build-plugin` to launch guided plugin creation. It asks targeted questions to determine the right extensibility mechanism — CLAUDE.md files, skills, commands, hooks, or agents — then generates properly structured files following documented patterns.

```bash
claude plugin install possiblaw-build-plugin --marketplace PossibLaw
```

### possiblaw-guardrails

General-purpose safety hooks for Claude Code. Blocks destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `sudo rm`, `curl | bash`, force-push to main), protects sensitive files (`.env`, SSH keys, credentials), auto-formats code after writes, and validates task completion before sessions end. Ships with a curated blacklist and escalation prompts for risky-but-not-fatal commands.

```bash
claude plugin install possiblaw-guardrails --marketplace PossibLaw
```

### possiblaw-legal

Single-command legal retrieval plugin for novice builders. `/possiblaw-legal` now asks users whether to search `Skills`, `ContractCodex`, `SEC EDGAR`, or `All`, then returns either top skill matches or a prompt-ready evidence pack with citations. It includes a runtime entrypoint for tool wrappers: `possiblaw-legal/retrieval/run-search.mjs`.

```bash
claude plugin install possiblaw-legal --marketplace PossibLaw
```

### possiblaw-vibe

Discovery-first project planning for non-coders. Use `/possiblaw-vibe` to guide goal definition, budget constraints, and tech stack selection, then generate a complete dev environment with docs, helper scripts, and a debugging agent.

```bash
claude plugin install possiblaw-vibe --marketplace PossibLaw
```

## Getting Started

### Option A: Using the interactive UI

1. Open Claude Code and type `/plugin`
2. Press the **right arrow key** to navigate to the **Discover** tab
3. Select **Add Marketplace**
4. Enter the GitHub repo: `PossibLaw/PossibLaw-Plugins`
5. Once added, browse the marketplace and install any plugin from the list

### Option B: Using the command line

First, add the PossibLaw marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add --source github --repo PossibLaw/PossibLaw-Plugins
```

Then install any plugin:

```bash
claude plugin install possiblaw-build-plugin --marketplace PossibLaw
claude plugin install possiblaw-guardrails --marketplace PossibLaw
claude plugin install possiblaw-legal --marketplace PossibLaw
claude plugin install possiblaw-vibe --marketplace PossibLaw
```

## What's Next

More plugins are on the way to help legal professionals architect what's next in legal. Stay tuned.

## Using These in Codex

These packages are authored in Claude plugin format, so Codex does not install them with `claude plugin install`.

Use this pattern instead:

1. Open the plugin's workflow docs and run the same process in Codex.
2. Configure any external MCP dependency in Codex (example for legal skills):
   `codex mcp add agentskills --url https://skills.case.dev/api/mcp`
3. In Codex prompts, explicitly request that workflow (example: "Use the legal workflow from this repo and show top 5 skills for contract review").

For possiblaw-legal specifically, see:
- `possiblaw-legal/docs/codex-usage.md`
- `possiblaw-legal/docs/agent-contract.md`
- `possiblaw-legal/retrieval/README.md`
